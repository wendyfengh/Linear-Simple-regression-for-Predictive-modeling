# Linear-regression-for-Predictive-modeling
Project Work from class to predict the possible volume of a tree based on one of their variable(GIRTH) the independent variable affecting our dependent variable in this case, the volume of the tree. Using the data set in RStudio called (Tree).
Applying the linear simple regression as there is just one independet and one dependent variable, In my opinion it is based the cause and effect of this experimentation.
